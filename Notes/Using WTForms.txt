Using WTForms

--->> Flask -WTF Form Classes

-> Simple Python class inheriting from flask_wtf.Form

-> Fields
Many field classes for different kind of input
StringField, DataRequired, DateField, BooleanField, SelectField, HiddenField, etc.
Note: flask_wtf include HTML5 forms in flask.ext.wtf.HTML5

-> Pass a list of validators to the fields
url = URLField('url', validators=[DataRequired(), url()])


--->> WTForms in Views

-> Create a form instance
form  = BookmarkForm()
This will be filled with any data from the request, if any

-> Check: was the form submitted and does it validate?
form.validate_on_submit()

-> Get data from fields
url = form.url.data

-> Make sure to pass the form to the template
render_template('add.html', form=form)


--->> WTForms in Template

-> Don't forget CSRF protection
{{form.hidden_tag()}}
Need a secret key

CSRF - Cross Side Request Forgery Attacks.
without this the WTForms will not let you submit the form

-> Render fields
{{ form.url }}
Keyword arguments will become HTMl attributes
{{ form.url(class = "fancy", size = 50) }}

-> Errors
{% for error in form.url.errors %}
