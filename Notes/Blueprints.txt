Review : Blueprints


--->> Blueprints

-> A blueprint of how to construct or extend an application
Not an app, but like app
Can provide views and/or resources like static files or templates, or models, etc.

-> Purpose
Break up growing application into modules
Re-usable modules that can registered on multiple apps

-> Blueprints don't have to be in their own package
But most of the time, they will be


--->> Creating and Registering Blueprints

        from flask import Blueprint
        auth = Blueprint('auth', __name__)
        from . import views

        from .auth import auth as auth_blueprint
        app.register_blueprint(auth_blueprint, url_prefix = '/auth')

-> Views are registered with @auth.route instead of app.route

-> When referencing views from a blueprint (url_for)
Prefix the name with the blueprint name : 'auth.login'
From within the blueprint itself : '.login'
