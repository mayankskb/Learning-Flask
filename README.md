# Learning-Flask
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.

This repository contains `flask notes` and a sample application in flask named as  `Themos`.  
Thermos - a blogging engine or rather I should say that it is a bookmarking platform built using Flask and for databse I used sqlite3.
